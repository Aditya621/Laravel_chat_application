Here i am using **Pusher** for chat Application

Laravel makes it easy to build modern applications with realtime interactions by providing an event broadcasting system which allows developers to share the same event names between the server-side code and the client-side JavaScript application.

Pusher, on the other hand, is an easy and reliable platform for building scalable realtime applications. Laravel provides support for Pusher out of the box, which makes building realtime applications with Laravel and Pusher seamless. In fact, Pusher has emerged as one of the Laravel communityâ€™s preferred tools to make apps realtime.

And here is the demo of this **Chat Aplication**
